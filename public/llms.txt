# Marginalia

> Annotate markdown documents with notes for LLM consumption.

Marginalia is a browser-based tool for reviewing and annotating markdown documents. Users paste markdown content, read through the rendered document, and attach free-form notes to selected text ranges. The annotated document exports as a single markdown file with inline annotations in curly braces, optimized for pasting into LLM conversations.

## Features
- Paste markdown, view rendered with toggle to raw source
- Select text to attach annotation notes (Google Docs comment style)
- Double-click to edit markdown blocks inline
- Export with inline `{note}` annotations placed next to their target text
- Copy to clipboard or download as .md file
- Dark mode with system preference detection
- No backend, no accounts — runs entirely in the browser
